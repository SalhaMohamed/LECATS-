# LECATS: Lecturer's Class Attendance Tracking System

## üìñ Project Overview

LECATS is a full-stack web application designed to modernize and streamline the process of tracking lecturer attendance at an academic institution. This system replaces manual, paper-based methods with a secure, role-based digital platform, ensuring accurate and efficient record-keeping for administrative and academic management.

The application features distinct dashboards for different user roles, each tailored to their specific responsibilities within the academic workflow.
